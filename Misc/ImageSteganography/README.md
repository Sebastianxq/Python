# Purpose
 The encode script is capable of hiding a message inside an arbitrary picture. Utilize the decode program to reveal the message. These scripts were done in order to understand the concept of steganography from a coding perspective

# How to run
You will need a .png file that is roughly 1080p resolution and labelled as "test1". The message that is encoded is similarly hardcoded. After you have these two set, run the program with "python3 encode.py" and "python3 decode.py"
