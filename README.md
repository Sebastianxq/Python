# Can I use these files?
While there is no way I could stop you from downloading these files to pass them off as your own, that is <b>ILLEGAL</b> and all files within 
this directory should be used as guidance for your own projects.

# One of these programs doesn't compile correctly, why?
Try switching between python2 and python3, if that doesn't work refer to the README as the project may potentially be 
incomplete
