To learn more about the programs contained within this directory please refer to the READMEs present within each of the project subdirectories.

# One of these programs doesn't compile correctly, why?
Some projects may have been written in Python2 instead of Python3 and vice versa, attempt to switch between the 2 versions.

# WAIT A MINUTE! WHY IS MOST OF THIS REPOSITORY OBJECTIVE C
One of my previous projects required a code "stub (More like a code WHOLE amirite?) of some Objective C from the software Ghidra created by the NSA. For the time being, i'm not aware of any way this negatively impacts me besides some backend stats monitoring but might delete it in the future if I can figure out a good enough reason to do so.
