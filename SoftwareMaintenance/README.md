# Purpose

This repository contains programs that data mine information from
public repositories in order to answer some hypothesis regarding the nature
of larger corperations and the cyclomatic complexity of their code. This is part of a course on Software Maintenance that, at the time of writing this, I am taking as part of my graduate coursework.

# Hypothesis
These are the questions that I plan to solve utilizign the scripts found within this repository. Note that while this repository contains scripts to extract the needed information from other repositories: further analysis is likely needed to refine the information into a solution for the questions.
1.)What is the general distribution of the cyclomatic complexity?
2.)Who has removed the most lines of code? Have they added more code than they have removed?
3.)Are there any type of security issues that are recurring within the repository?


#Legal Stuff
All scripts within this repository are my own with the exception of segments pulled from the repository that I analyzed (The NSA's Ghidra repository). 

All of the scripts created here should be also considered open source, just please don't plagiarize :)
