#### [[CV](./papers/CV.pdf)]

|

I am an Assistant Professor of the Department of [ Computer
Science](http://cs.utep.edu/) at [The University of Texas at El
Paso](http://utep.edu) (UTEP). I joined the department in Fall 2017. Before
that, I was a Research Assistant Professor and the Assistant Director of
[CyberShare Center of Excellence](http://cybershare.utep.edu) at UTEP.

I graduated with a PhD from the Department of [Computer
Science](https://cs.vt.edu/) at Virginia Tech. I received my MS from Montana
State University-Bozeman in Computer Science and BS from Shahjalal University
of Science and Technology in Computer Science and Engineering.

I work on broad areas of data science, specially information retrieval and
integration, data mining, prediction, and recommendation. I use **data
science** concepts to address computational challenges in application areas of
cyber-security, health informatics, and gamification.  
I am looking for highly motivated graduate students who would like to work in
these areas. Please email me if you are interested.
