If you wish to make an advising appointment with me, please go to my 

Calendly advising calendar and select three times out of those when I am available
that work for you. I will then send you an email with a confirmed 
appointment time for a 15-minute appointment. When you select a time on 
the hour or half hour please be available for either that time or a time
that is 15 minutes later. Please try to do this two days in advance if
possible.


If you wish to have a 15 or 30 minute meeting with me 
(for example, if you are a student in my class), please go to 
my Calendly webpage
and select 15 Minute Meeting or 30 Minute Meeting to schedule a 
meeting time. If you can't find a time that works for you, please
send me an email to schedule a different time.
