[CV]



I am an Assistant Professor of the Department of  Computer Science at The University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP). I joined the department in Fall 2017. Before that, I was a Research Assistant Professor and the Assistant Director of CyberShare Center of Excellence at UTEP.
              
            I graduated with a PhD from the Department of Computer Science at Virginia Tech. I received my MS from  Montana State University-Bozeman in Computer Science and BS from Shahjalal University of Science and Technology in Computer Science and Engineering.

                       
               
I work on broad areas of data science, specially information retrieval and integration, data mining, prediction, and recommendation. I use data science concepts to address computational challenges in application areas of cyber-security, health informatics, and gamification. 
                       
                       I am looking for highly motivated graduate students who would like to work in these areas. Please email me if you are interested.
