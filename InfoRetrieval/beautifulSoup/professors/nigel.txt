&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp 















Nigel G. Ward, Professor of Computer Science, received his Ph.D. from
the University of California at Berkeley in 1991.  On the faculty of
the University of Tokyo for ten years before joining UTEP in 2002,
 in 2015-2016 he was a Fulbright Scholar and
Visiting Professor at Kyoto University.  In
2019 he co-organized special sessions on Modeling Meaning-Bearing
Configurations of Prosodic Features at ICPhS
 and Implications of Deep Learning for Dialog
Modeling at Sigdial, and taught introduction to prosody
as an Interspeech mini-tutorial and as a course
at  the LSA Linguistics Institute. He is 
chair of the Speech Prosody SIG

and the author of 
Prosodic Patterns in English Conversation. 
 

more background
vita



Ward's research areas are at the intersection of spoken language and
human-computer interaction.  Current topics include the subtle
non-lexical and prosodic signals that enable inference of a dialog
partner's needs, intentions, and feelings at the sub-second level; and
ways to model and exploit these phenomena to improve dialog system
responsiveness, information retrieval from audio, and language
assessment and teaching.   These projects apply multiple methods:
linguistic, corpus-based modeling, systems building, and experimental.
