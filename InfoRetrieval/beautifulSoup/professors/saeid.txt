In particular, I am interested in analyzing differential properties of cyber systems that can lead to information leaks, denial-of-service issues, and adversarial-example attacks. My findings help discover multiple performance bugs in popular ML libraries such as scikit-learn and timing side-channel vulnerabilities in critical Java libraries such as OpenJDK and Apache ([1],[2],[3],[4],[5]). Funds are available for students interested in cybersecurity, machine learning, and software engineering. In particular, (1) the application of machine learning for testing/debugging software systems; (2) reliable and secure machine learning; (3) programming languages and verification for software security; (4) probabilistic programming for privacy and fairness.  Please reach out if you are interested in one of these topics.Research AreaApplication of Machine Learning for Software Security and PerformanceRobustness, privacy, and fairness of Machine Learning InferencesDifferential testing and debugging for Software and ML systemsSeminar Talks and LecturesJuly 2020.
