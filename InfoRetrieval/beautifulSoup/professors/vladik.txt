approaches), reasoning under uncertainty More than 1500
publications 
Summary of Research

In interval computations, I am looking for general (feasible) methods to
estimate the accuracy of the results of data processing algorithms.
I am also interested in the mathematical foundations of intelligent
control, with the goal of finding the optimal way to transform
expert operator's knowledge into the actual control strategy.
