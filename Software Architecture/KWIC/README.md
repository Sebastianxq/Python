This assignment asked us to implement a "Key Word In Context" program for any arbitraty text file. 

Initially I drafted a algorithm that generated all combinations of each word in the line and another algorithm that
circularly shifted each sentence to get all possible orders.

The first algorithm wasn't a requirement but I misinterpreted the prompt and decided I might as well leave it for future reference.

This script can be run from the CLI and takes a text file from your current directory as the input.
